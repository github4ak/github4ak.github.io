## About Me

Welcome to my personal webpage.

I am a final year master's student in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/">University of Utah</a>. My software engineering experiences have helped me understand and implement varied technologies in the software domain. I am looking forward to joining a team where I can help build end-to-end solutions, interact and learn from my peers, and contribute to the technological industry.

## Academic Projects

[Determining meterics for reconstruction of cornea using Image processing and neural network modeling](https://github.com/github4ak/image-processing-cornea)
<br>
Developed an image processing algorithm followed by a neural network model in MATLAB to predict post keratoplasty corneal thickness from preoperative measurements which aids in achieving predictable refractive errors after ALK (Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty).
<br>

[Control of Hybrid Electric Vehicle (H.E.V) using fuzzy logic](https://github.com/github4ak/fuzzy-logic-HEV-controller)
<br>
Designed a fuzzy logic based controller for an H.E.V in MATLAB which involved modeling of various components of an H.E.V and validated the efficiency parameters which included generator power and scaling factor.
