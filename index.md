## About Me

Welcome to my personal webpage

I am a final year master's student in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/">University of Utah</a>. My software engineering experiences have helped me understand and implement varied technologies in the software domain. I am looking forward to joining a team where I can help build end-to-end solutions, interact and learn from my peers, and contribute to the technological industry.
